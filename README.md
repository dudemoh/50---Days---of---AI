# 50 Days of AI – Execution Sprint

This is my 50-day AI sprint — not a course, not a challenge — a warpath.  
The goal: prove I can build and deploy AI tools that solve real problems.  
No fluff. Just execution.

## Who I Am

I'm Aymen Mohammed. Based in Ethiopia. Hungry to earn my seat with the best in the industry — FAANG or any serious tech company that pays what I'm worth.

## My Tech Stack

- GPT-4 / OpenAI
- LangChain
- Python
- Vector Databases (Pinecone, FAISS)
- Streamlit / Gradio (for quick UI demos)
- FastAPI (for APIs if needed)
- GitHub & LinkedIn for public accountability

## Goals

- Ship 10+ real AI micro-projects in 50 days.
- Build a reputation on LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter/X.
- Get hired or contracted by a top-tier company, remote or relocated.
- Document every step to prove consistent, focused execution.
